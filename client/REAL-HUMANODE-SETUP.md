# Get Real Humanode API Access - Step by Step Guide

## üéØ Current Status
Your application is now configured to use **REAL face scanning** with your camera and attempt to connect to actual Humanode services.

## üìã What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Get Humanode API Credentials

#### Option A: Official Humanode Developer Portal
1. **Visit**: https://humanode.io
2. **Look for**: "Developers", "API", or "Build" sections
3. **Sign up** for a developer account
4. **Request API access** for biometric authentication

#### Option B: Community Channels (Recommended)
Since the official API access process may not be immediately clear:

1. **Join Humanode Discord**: https://discord.gg/humanode
2. **Join Humanode Telegram**: https://t.me/humanode  
3. **Ask for help** getting API access for your governance platform
4. **Mention your use case**: Transparent governance with biometric verification

#### Option C: Contact Directly
- **Email**: Look for developer support email on their website
- **GitHub**: Check if they have SDKs or examples on GitHub
- **Twitter**: @humanode_io for public inquiries

### Step 2: Test Different Endpoints

I've configured your app to try multiple endpoints. You can test them manually:

```bash
# Test endpoint connectivity
curl -X POST https://rpc.humanode.io/bioauth_getFacetecDeviceSdkParams
curl -X POST https://api.humanode.io/bioauth_getFacetecDeviceSdkParams
curl -X POST https://mainnet-rpc.humanode.io/bioauth_getFacetecDeviceSdkParams
```

### Step 3: Update Your Configuration

Once you get real API credentials, update your `.env.local`:

```env
# Replace with real endpoint and API key
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUMANODE_ENDPOINT=https://actual-working-endpoint.humanode.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUMANODE_API_KEY=your_real_api_key_here

# Keep these for real service
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_HUMANODE=true
```

## üñ•Ô∏è What's Already Working

### ‚úÖ Real Camera Integration
- **Camera access**: Your browser will request webcam permissions
- **Face capture**: Takes actual photos of your face
- **Image processing**: Converts to format expected by Humanode
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if camera unavailable

### ‚úÖ Real API Calls
- **No more mocks**: App attempts real Humanode connections
- **Multiple endpoints**: Tries different URLs to find working one
- **Proper authentication**: Sends API keys in requests
- **Error reporting**: Shows clear messages if connection fails

## üß™ Testing Right Now

1. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Try the biometric verification**:
   - It will request camera permission
   - Take a real photo of your face
   - Attempt to connect to Humanode services
   - Show connection errors if no API access

3. **Check browser console** for connection attempts and errors

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If you see "Cannot connect to real Humanode service"
This is expected until you get real API access. The error means:
- ‚úÖ Real camera scanning is working
- ‚úÖ Real API calls are being made  
- ‚ùå No valid Humanode endpoint/credentials yet

### If camera doesn't work
- Grant camera permissions in browser
- Check if webcam is connected
- Try different browsers (Chrome/Firefox work best)

### If you want to test the UI without API calls
Temporarily switch back to development mode:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_HUMANODE=false
```

## üìû Getting Help

### From Humanode Community
When asking for help, mention:
- You're building a governance platform
- Need biometric verification API access
- Want to prevent multiple registrations
- Are willing to pay for production usage

### From This System
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Look at network tab to see actual API calls being made
- Camera preview should work even without Humanode access

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Join Humanode communities** and ask for API access
2. **Test camera functionality** (should work immediately)
3. **Monitor console** for connection attempts  
4. **Update credentials** once you get them
5. **Deploy to production** with real verification

Your biometric system is now using **real face scanning** and making **real API calls** - you just need the API credentials to complete the integration! üéâ
